# Snapmaker J1 config files for PrusaSlicer
> ⚠️  You need to have Prusa Slicer 2.6 alpha 3 or a newer version installed

This is a remix of [Dylan @macdylan and McGybeer @McGybeer from the community](https://forum.snapmaker.com/t/great-sharing-prusaslicer-profiles-by-dylan-and-mcgybeer/28796)

Unfortunately, that profile didn't have the capability to detect whether the second extruder was being used or not. This made it difficult to set the appropriate pre-heat settings for nozzle and bed temperature, as well as prime the extruder(s).

However, a new variable called "is_extruder_used" has been introduced in PrusaSlicer 2.6_alpha3, which now enables us to detect whether the second extruder is being used and adjust the settings accordingly.

As a result, I have updated the gcode to consider all possible scenarios for both single and dual extruder use. 

In addition, I have also made some adjustments to the printer settings that will help to enhance the print quality and minimize any potential issues that may arise during the printing process. Overall, these changes will ensure a smoother and more efficient printing experience.

Click **Custom G-code**, and add the following G-code into the **End G-code input** box.

    ;
    ; DON'T REMOVE these lines if you're using the smfix
    ; min_x = [first_layer_print_min_0]
    ; min_y = [first_layer_print_min_1]
    ; max_x = [first_layer_print_max_0]
    ; max_y = [first_layer_print_max_1]
    ; max_z = [max_layer_z]
    ;



> ⚠️ The above G-code is important and necessary for the Copy and Mirror modes.  If missing or not added correctly, there are chances that extruders will hit the bed due to wrong orientation calculations.
