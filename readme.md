# Snapmaker J1 config files for [PrusaSlicer](https://help.prusa3d.com/category/prusaslicer_204)
> ‚ö†Ô∏è  You need to have [Prusa Slicer 2.6 alpha 3 or a newer](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/tags) version installed

This is a remix of [Dylan @macdylan and McGybeer @McGybeer from the community](https://forum.snapmaker.com/t/great-sharing-prusaslicer-profiles-by-dylan-and-mcgybeer/28796).  

Unfortunately, that profile didn't have the capability to detect whether the second extruder was being used or not. This made it difficult to set the appropriate pre-heat settings for nozzle and bed temperature, as well as prime the extruder(s).

However, a new variable called "is_extruder_used" has been introduced in PrusaSlicer 2.6_alpha3, which now enables us to detect whether the second extruder is being used and adjust the settings accordingly.

As a result, I have updated the gcode to consider all possible scenarios for both single and dual extruder use. 

In addition, I have also made some adjustments to the printer settings that will help to enhance the print quality and minimize any potential issues that may arise during the printing process. Overall, these changes will ensure a smoother and more efficient printing experience.

The package also includes Printer Settings and Print profile from Dylan/McGybeer, which can be used for comparison purposes. You are free to remove any components that you do not need. The appropriate profiles are preselected by default and are ready for printing.

> ü™Ñ As long as your project uses a single extruder, you can select mirror, copy, or backup after loading the gcode on the printer.

> ‚õîÔ∏è  Before you proceed, remove all references to Snapmaker or J1 from the PrintSettings, Filament Setting, and Printer Settings to avoid any remnants from the previous configuration imports.

## Instructions for importing Profile

### Download
[**PrusaSlicer 2.6.0-alpha3 or a newer version**](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/tags)

### üöÄ SAVE PRINTER SETTINGS ‚ÄºÔ∏è
It was brought to my attention that PrusaSlicer might prompt you to save changes to the print profile but doesn't save printer settings. 
To avoid any confusion, it's important to manually save it before you close the application.

### üìå Optionals 
There are certain personal preferences that you can disable if you wish. To do so, follow these steps:
```
1.  Click on "Printer Settings (Expert)"
2.  Go to "Custom G-code"
3.  Click on the "Start G-Code Input Box"
4.  Change "{if 1 == 1}" to "{if 1 == 0}"
```

# Smfix Program by Dylan

This [smfix program](https://github.com/macdylan/Snapmaker2Slic3rPostProcessor) can help quickly **load the printing information** (including the image and parameters) of G-code files generated by Prusaslicer **on the Touchscreen**, effective even for large files.

### Instructions

Unzip the file into a path that contains no space. For example: <br />
**windows**		$ *D:\smfix\smfix-win64.exe*<br />
**Mac**				$ *~/Applications/PrusaSlicer/smfix-darwin-arm64*

>You may have to change the permission for in terminal with the following command: <br />
chmod 755 *~/Applications/PrusaSlicer/smfix-darwin-arm64*<br /><br />
To ensure that the path is correct, you can use drag and drop into PrusaSlicer post-processing. Similarly, when setting permissions, type ‚Äúchmod 755‚Äù in the terminal and drag the file into the terminal. To verify that the permission is set correctly just type
```ls -l [file]``` and it should show
```-rwxr-xr-x@ [file]```

On Prusaslicer, click **Print Settings (Expert)** > **Output Options**, and enter the path above into the Post-processing scripts input box.

> ‚ÄºÔ∏è Please keep in mind that each print profile must be updated to include the new path.

Click **Custom G-code**, and make sure you have the following G-code into the **End G-code input** box.

    ;
    ; DON'T REMOVE these lines if you're using the smfix
    ; min_x = [first_layer_print_min_0]
    ; min_y = [first_layer_print_min_1]
    ; max_x = [first_layer_print_max_0]
    ; max_y = [first_layer_print_max_1]
    ; max_z = [max_layer_z]
    ;


> ‚ö†Ô∏è The above G-code is important and necessary for the Copy and Mirror modes.  If missing or not added correctly, there are chances that extruders will hit the bed due to wrong orientation calculations.

After saving the gcode file to a local folder, it will be automatically uploaded to the J1. You can access it by selecting it from the list of files displayed on the J1's screen. 
> ‚ö† Please note that if you are already on the file list display when you export/upload the gcode, you will need to return to the home screen and re-enter the list of files to refresh the list.

# Multiple extruder

PrusaSlicer does not store the purging setting on the bundle profile. Therefore, you'll need to make the adjustment manually to ensure it is set correctly.

Although there is no scientific explanation behind it, the community recommends 5 „é£ as a best practice for dual color printing.
